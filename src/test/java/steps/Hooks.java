/**
 * The Hooks class is responsible for setting up and tearing down each test scenario.
 *
 * Before every scenario, it sets the base URI for the API so that all HTTP requests
 * are sent to the correct endpoint. After each scenario, it logs whether the scenario
 * passed or failed.
 *
 * This class uses PicoContainer for dependency injection, meaning that the shared TestContext
 * (which holds data like API responses, tokens, and booking IDs) is automatically provided.
 *
 * In simple terms, think of Hooks as the pre- and post-conditions for each test: it prepares
 * the environment before a test runs and cleans up (or logs results) afterward.
